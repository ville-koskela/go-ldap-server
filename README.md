## Setup

Easiest way to setup your dev-tools is by using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html). Once setup and [go-plugin](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang) installed, you are good to go. Go to
project root-folder and run command:

```
asdf install
```

## Githooks

You can add `.githooks` directory to your hooks path by running command:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
